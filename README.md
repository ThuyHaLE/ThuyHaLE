## Hi I'm Thuy Ha <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="28px" height="28px" alt="hi">

Hi, I am Thuy Ha. 🐳
I am studying data science 💻⎈.
I am concerned about comprehensive management systems and developmental research areas. ☁️
I believe, the bigger it is, the more an organization will always need a comprehensive management system to maintain and develop in the long term. And shortly data science will bring us to get close to the best solution. 📝💖🎉
So, my career will be focused and oriented toward comprehensive management systems and developmental research areas.
